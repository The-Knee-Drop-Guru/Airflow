# Airflow MLOps Pipeline for building "BTC Price Prediction & Analytics Platform"
This repository contains a MLOps pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline is for the project "Building a BTC Price Prediction & Analytics Platform". It is developed by **Team The-Knee-Drop-Guru**, as part of the Programmers' Data Engineering Course(4th). The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of Cardano native tokens using the DEXHUNTER API and deploy it as a web application.
